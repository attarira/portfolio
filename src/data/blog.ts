      "RAG has become the standard for grounding LLMs, but simple vector similarity often fails on complex, multi-hop queries. In this post, I explore my recent experiments combining SpanBERT and Gemini to extract semantic relationships and structure them into a lightweight knowledge graph. By fusing classical IR with transformer-based extraction, we can bypass the context window limitations and significantly improve search relevance.",

The standard playbook is simple: chunk your documents, run them through an embedding model (like text-embedding-ada-002 or Vertex Gecko), and stuff the top-K cosine similarity matches into the context window. But when building systems for complex technical documentation or entangled legal contracts, this naïve approach breaks down fast."

If you ask a standard RAG system 'What are the dependencies of the Data Processor service?', it might just surface chunks that happen to mention 'Data Processor' and 'dependencies' in similar syntactic structures, rather than actually tracing the dependency graph. Multi-hop reasoning—where answering a question requires piecing together Fact A from Document 1 and Fact B from Document 2—is notoriously difficult for vector searches to resolve cleanly."

Effectively, you are breaking down a centralized hospital and dynamically distributing its nurses, doctors, and equipment across a city."
